# Valley of Concordia
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Valley of Concordia is a a role-playing game based off of the Flare engine.  The goal is to produce an 8-bit length game within the adventure RPG genre.  Over the course of development, I hope to push the ability of FLARE to develop a storyline, even within a simple narrative structure.  I also hope it's fun!

## Dependencies

See the README.engine for information regarding installation of dependencies.

## Building from Source

There are several ways to build the concordia executable. For developers the cmake method is recommended as it has low overhead when it comes to changes in the code. However you can also build concordia with just one call to your compiler including all source files at once.

### Building with CMake

To build flare, go to the main directory/folder and run the following commands:

    cmake .
    make

If you want the game installed system-wide, as root, install with:

    make install

The game will be installed into '/usr/local' by default.  You can set different paths in the cmake step, like:

    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:STRING="/usr" ..

### Building with g++

If you prefer building directly with C++, the command will be something like this.

Windows plus MinGW (depending on where your SDL dev headers are)

    g++ -I C:\MinGW\include\SDL src\*.cpp src\*.c -o concordia.exe -lmingw32 -lSDLmain -lSDL -lSDL_image -lSDL_mixer -lSDL_ttf

Linux (depending on where your SDL includes are)

    g++ -I /usr/include/SDL src/*.cpp src/*.c -o concordia -lSDL -lSDL_image -lSDL_mixer -lSDL_ttf

## Running Valley of Concordia

If the program is installing system-wide (i.e., you typed 'make install' and it worked), you can run it just by executing the 'concordia' command.

If you did not perform the installation step, you should find the binary in in the top directory, and run it from there, like this:

    ./concordia

Also, in newer versions, the game can be launched from an icon in your main menu in your GUI environment (KDE, GNOME, etc.).

If you're running concordia from your operating system's gui file browser (e.g. Windows Explorer or OSX Finder), you'll want to use one of the provided launchers.  This helps the concordia executable use its own working directory, so it can see all those data folders.



## Settings

Settings are stored in one of these places:

    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/concordia
    $HOME/.config/concordia
    ./config

Here you can enable fullscreen, change the game resolution, enable mouse-move, and change keybindings. The settings files are created the first time you run Flare.



## Save Files

Save files are stored in one of these places:

    $XDG_DATA_HOME/concordia
    $HOME/.local/share/concordia
    ./saves

If permissions are correct, the game is automatically saved when you exit.
